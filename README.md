# Project Description

The Employee Tracker is a command line application that allows the user to manipulate data in a SQL database. The app is designed to interact with 3 SQL databases: one called "employees," one called "roles," and one called "departments." Each employee has a "title" that is a member of the "roles" database, and each role is associated with a member of the "departments" database.
